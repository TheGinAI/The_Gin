# The Gin - Interactive AI Card Game

## Introduction

## Description

## Motivation
In the world we're living in today, it's crucial to utilize limited resources better to maximize our profit in the minimum possible time. In this instance, we're facing a similar objective to the card game 'gin,' whose goal is to form a specific combination in as few turns as possible. The project aims to develop a reinforcement learning algorithm-trained AI card game named 'gin' that allows humans to play against AI. The game 'gin' is played by observing other players' discarded cards and your current deck to form a combination of sets and runs. The training process is completed by having two AI agents complete a set and run a combination with seven cards in the shortest turns possible. AI agents will be able to observe and analyze other's player's actions to make better decisions. Moreover, this project is introduced for both educational and entertainment purposes.

### Education
For educational purpose, the projects aims to test and compare the limit of AI agent's decision making in shared resources with limit memory space to decent human players. This project will be developed with TensorFlow's environment-agent feature that allows user to develop their action environment, agent steps, and rewarding systems for their specific goal. The learning / training process is done through unsupervised learning to investigate AI agent's ability in decision making. We're hoping to see the difference between AI-agent and human player's action by testing if AI-agent are able to analysis other player's action to avoiding forming the same combination. Further more, human player tends to debate between continuning competing other player in case with simular combination and we would like to see how AI-agent would handle this instance. 

### Entertainment
For entertainment purpose, we're aiming to develop a more human-like AI agent in card game by modying it's memory space. Typically, AI agent is difficult to compete with due to it's memory capability. For instance, AI agent will be able to remember all past discarded cards to analyze what cards are still in the deck and decide it's target combination accordingly. We're projecting to limit AI agent's memory space to make them more human-like to create cases where AI agent and human players will be coincidentally forming the same combination; this will add more entertainment value.
